# Introduction

Go 1.11 added an experimental port to WebAssembly.  Go 1.12 has
improved some parts of it, with further improvements expected in Go
1.13.

WebAssembly is described on its https://webassembly.org[home page] as:

> WebAssembly (abbreviated _Wasm_) is a binary instruction format for
> a stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable
> target for compilation of high-level languages like C/C++/Rust,
> enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.

**********************************************************************
If you're new to WebAssembly read the https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/WebAssembly#getting-started[Getting Started] section, watch some of the https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/WebAssembly#go-webassembly-talks[Go WebAssembly talks],
then take a look at the https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/WebAssembly#further-examples[Further examples] below.
**********************************************************************


# Getting Started

This page assumes a functional Go 1.11 or newer installation. For
troubleshooting, see the https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/InstallTroubleshooting[Install Troubleshooting]
page.

To compile a basic Go package for the web:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello, WebAssembly!")
}
```

Set `GOOS=js` and `GOARCH=wasm` environment variables to compile
for WebAssembly:

```sh
$ GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -o main.wasm
```

That will build the package and produce an executable WebAssembly
module file named main.wasm. The .wasm file extension will make it
easier to serve it over HTTP with the correct Content-Type header
later on. 

Note that you can only compile main packages. Otherwise, you will get an object file that cannot be run in WebAssembly. If you have a package that you want to be able to use with WebAssembly, convert it to a main package and build a binary.

To execute main.wasm in a browser, we'll also need a JavaScript
support file, and a HTML page to connect everything together.

Copy the JavaScript support file:

```sh
$ cp "$(go env GOROOT)/misc/wasm/wasm_exec.js" .
```

Create an `index.html` file:

```HTML
<html>
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8"/>
		<script src="wasm_exec.js"></script>
		<script>
			const go = new Go();
			WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(fetch("main.wasm"), go.importObject).then((result) => {
				go.run(result.instance);
			});
		</script>
	</head>
	<body></body>
</html>
```

If your browser doesn't yet support `WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming`,
you can use a https://github.com/golang/go/blob/b2fcfc1a50fbd46556f7075f7f1fbf600b5c9e5d/misc/wasm/wasm_exec.html#L17-L22[polyfill].

Then serve the three files (`index.html`, `wasm_exec.js`, and
`main.wasm`) from a web server. For example, with
https://github.com/shurcooL/goexec#goexec[`goexec`]:

```sh
# install goexec: go get -u github.com/shurcooL/goexec
$ goexec 'http.ListenAndServe(`:8080`, http.FileServer(http.Dir(`.`)))'
```

Or use your own https://play.golang.org/p/pZ1f5pICVbV[basic HTTP server command].  

Note: for the `goexec` command to work on Unix-like systems, you must https://golang.org/doc/install#tarball[add the path environment variable] for Go to your shell's `profile`. Go's getting started guide explains this:  

> Add /usr/local/go/bin to the PATH environment variable. You can do this by adding this line to your /etc/profile (for a system-wide installation) or $HOME/.profile:

> `export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin`

> Note: changes made to a profile file may not apply until the next time you log into your computer

Finally, navigate to http://localhost:8080/index.html, open the
JavaScript debug console, and you should see the output. You can
modify the program, rebuild `main.wasm`, and refresh to see new
output.

# Executing WebAssembly with Node.js

It's possible to execute compiled WebAssembly modules using Node.js
rather than a browser, which can be useful for testing and automation.

With Node installed and in your `PATH`, set the `-exec` flag to the
location of `go_js_wasm_exec` when you execute `go run` or `go test`.

By default, `go_js_wasm_exec` is in the `misc/wasm` directory of your
Go installation.

```
$ GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go run -exec="$(go env GOROOT)/misc/wasm/go_js_wasm_exec" .
Hello, WebAssembly!
$ GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go test -exec="$(go env GOROOT)/misc/wasm/go_js_wasm_exec"
PASS
ok  	example.org/my/pkg	0.800s
```

Adding `go_js_wasm_exec` to your `PATH` will allow `go run` and `go test` to work for `js/wasm` without having to manually provide the `-exec` flag each time:

```
$ export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOROOT)/misc/wasm"
$ GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go run .
Hello, WebAssembly!
$ GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go test
PASS
ok  	example.org/my/pkg	0.800s
```

## Running tests in the browser

You can also use https://github.com/agnivade/wasmbrowsertest[wasmbrowsertest] to run tests inside your browser. It automates the job of spinning up a webserver and uses headless Chrome to run the tests inside it and relays the logs to your console.

Same as before, just `go get github.com/agnivade/wasmbrowsertest` to get a binary. Rename that to `go_js_wasm_exec` and place it to your `PATH`

```
$ mv $GOPATH/bin/wasmbrowsertest $GOPATH/bin/go_js_wasm_exec
$ export PATH="$PATH:$GOPATH/bin"
$ GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go test
PASS
ok  	example.org/my/pkg	0.800s
```

Alternatively, use the `exec` test flag.
```
$ GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go test -exec="$GOPATH/bin/wasmbrowsertest"
```

# Configuring fetch options while using net/http

You can use the net/http library to make HTTP requests from Go, and they will be converted to https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API[fetch] calls. However, there isn't a direct mapping between the fetch https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/fetch#Parameters[options] and the http https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Client[client] options. To achieve this, we have some special header values that are recognized as fetch options. They are -

- `js.fetch:mode`: An option to the Fetch API mode setting. Valid values are: "cors", "no-cors", "same-origin", navigate". The default is "same-origin".

- `js.fetch:credentials`: An option to the Fetch API credentials setting. Valid values are: "omit", "same-origin", "include". The default is "same-origin".

- `js.fetch:redirect`: An option to the Fetch API redirect setting. Valid values are: "follow", "error", "manual". The default is "follow".

So as an example, if we want to set the mode as "cors" while making a request, it will be something like:

```go
req, err := http.NewRequest("GET", "http://localhost:8080", nil)
req.Header.Add("js.fetch:mode", "cors")
if err != nil {
  fmt.Println(err)
  return
}
resp, err := http.DefaultClient.Do(req)
if err != nil {
  fmt.Println(err)
  return
}
defer resp.Body.Close()
// handle the response
```

# WebAssembly in Chrome

If you run a newer version of Chrome there is a flag (`chrome://flags/#enable-webassembly-baseline`) to enable Liftoff, their new compiler, which should significantly improve load times.  Further info https://chinagdg.org/2018/08/liftoff-a-new-baseline-compiler-for-webassembly-in-v8/[here].


# Debugging

WebAssembly doesn't *yet* have any support for debuggers, so you'll
need to use the good 'ol `println()` approach for now to display
output on the JavaScript console.

An official https://github.com/WebAssembly/debugging[WebAssembly Debugging Subgroup]
has been created to address this, with some initial investigation and
proposals under way:

* https://fitzgen.github.io/wasm-debugging-capabilities/[WebAssembly Debugging Capabilities Living Standard]
  (https://github.com/fitzgen/wasm-debugging-capabilities[source code for the doc])
* https://yurydelendik.github.io/webassembly-dwarf/[DWARF for WebAssembly Target]
  (https://github.com/yurydelendik/webassembly-dwarf/[source code for the doc])

Please get involved and help drive this if you're interested in the Debugger side of things. :smile:

# Known bug(s)

Go releases prior to 1.11.2 https://github.com/golang/go/issues/27961[have a bug] which can generate incorrect wasm code in some (rare) circumstances.

If your Go code compiles to wasm without problem, but produces an error like this when run in the browser:

```
CompileError: wasm validation error: at offset 1269295: type mismatch: expression has type i64 but expected f64
```

Then you're probably hitting this error.

The solution is to upgrade to Go 1.11.2 or later.

# Reducing the size of Wasm files

At present, Go generates large Wasm files, with the smallest possible size being around ~2MB.  If your Go code imports libraries, this file size can increase dramatically.  10MB+ is common.

There are two main ways (for now) to reduce this file size:

1. Manually compress the .wasm file.
   a. Using `gz` compression reduces the ~2MB (minimum file size) example WASM file down to around 500kB.  It may be better to use https://github.com/google/zopfli[Zopfli] to do the gzip compression, as it gives better results than `gzip --best`, however it does take much longer to run.
   b. Using https://github.com/google/brotli[Brotli] for compression, the file sizes are markedly better than both Zopfli and `gzip --best`, and compression time is somewhere in between the two, too.  This https://github.com/andybalholm/brotli[(new) Brotli compressor] looks reasonable. 

Examples from https://github.com/johanbrandhorst[@johanbrandhorst]

**Example 1**
[width="25%",cols="^m,e,e",frame="topbot",options="header"]]
|=======
| Size | Command | Compression time
|16M | (uncompressed size) | N/A
|2.4M | `brotli -o test.wasm.br test.wasm` | 53.6s
|3.3M | `go-zopfli test.wasm` | 3m 2.6s
|3.4M | `gzip --best test.wasm` | 2.5s
|3.4M | `gzip test.wasm` | 0.8s
|=======

**Example 2**
[width="25%",cols="^m,e,e",frame="topbot",options="header"]]
|=======
| Size | Command | Compression time
|2.3M | (uncompressed size) | N/A
|496K | `brotli -o main.wasm.br main.wasm` | 5.7s
|640K | `go-zopfli main.wasm` | 16.2s
|660K | `gzip --best main.wasm` | 0.2s
|668K | `gzip main.wasm` | 0.2s
|=======

Use something like https://github.com/lpar/gzipped to automatically serve compressed files with correct headers, when available.

**2.** Use https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo[TinyGo] to generate the Wasm file instead.

TinyGo supports a subset of the Go language targeted for embedded devices, and has a WebAssembly output target.

While it does have limitations (not yet a full Go implementation), it is still fairly capable and the generated Wasm files are... tiny.  ~10kB isn't unusual.  The "Hello world" example is 575 bytes.  If you `gz -6` that, it drops down to 408 bytes. :wink:

This project is also very actively developed, so its capabilities are expanding out quickly. See https://tinygo.org/docs/guides/webassembly/ for more information on using WebAssembly with TinyGo.
